This file is for those who have receieved an error message from SQL when either using the new exercise file
or are unable to restore it.

Pre check:

1. Make sure you are using the latest version of pgAdmin, there are a few versions that were released that contained bugs. 
   We have confirmed the restore process works on pgadmin 4.22 and please use PostgreSQL 12 (even if you are on an older OS, 
   Postgresql 12 is likely supported by your OS now)

2. Make sure you selected PRE/POST/DATA to be switched to yes (green) for the Restore Options

3. Make sure you refresh the database

4. Make sure your bin file path is set up correctly, this part is slightly more complex, so to make sure it is set up correctly:

In pgAdmin4 go to: File > Preferences > Paths > Binary paths > PostgreSQL Binary Path

Sample paths as below (You need to change it according to your Postgres location),

If you are using Windows than provide path like: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\bin

If you are using Linux than provide path like: /opt/PostgreSQL/12/bin

If you are using Mac than provide path where you have installed PG: /Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin

Try a new restore and refresh after those changes and see if that fixes the issue.

Example path of data file stores in file on desktop: C:\Users\mohit\OneDrive\Desktop\SQL\SQL - Course Full\Section II\exercises.tar

Note: Remember to right click the new database name, refresh it and select "Query Tool".

Note: The new database has a public and cd schema. This means that the quieres for the "FROM" tables will now have
      "cd." in front of them. For example:

      SELECT * FROM cd.bookings;
      SELECT * FROM cd.facilities;
      SELECT * FROM cd.members;
